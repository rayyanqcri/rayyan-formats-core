An ontology for immune epitopes: application to the design of a broad scope database of immune reactivities,"BACKGROUND: Epitopes can be defined as the molecular structures bound by specific receptors, which are recognized during immune responses. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) project will catalog and organize information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes from infectious pathogens, experimental antigens and self-antigens, with a priority on NIAID Category A-C pathogens () and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Both intrinsic structural and phylogenetic features, as well as information relating to the interactions of the epitopes with the host's immune system will be catalogued. DESCRIPTION: To effectively represent and communicate the information related to immune epitopes, a formal ontology was developed. The semantics of the epitope domain and related concepts were captured as a hierarchy of classes, which represent the general and specialized relationships between the various concepts. A complete listing of classes and their properties can be found at . CONCLUSION: The IEDB's ontology is the first ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic chemical and biochemical information relating to immune epitopes with information relating to the interaction of these structures with molecules derived from the host immune system. We anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases will facilitate rigorous description of data related to immune epitopes, and might ultimately lead to completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-7580-1-2,PMC1287064,16305755,2005,9,20,"Sathiamurthy, Muthuraman; Peters, Bjoern; Bui, Huynh-Hoa; Sidney, John; Mokili, John; Wilson, Stephen S; Fleri, Ward; McGuinness Deborah L; Bourne, Philip E; Sette, Alessandro",Immunome Res,sha: ae19236936b05793ceac08ed5d58269c25486320; source_x: PMC; license: CC BY; Microsoft Academic Paper ID: ; WHO #Covidence: ; has_full_text: True
Aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to SARS-CoV-1,"<jats:p>A novel human coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, referred to as HCoV-19 here) that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now causing a pandemic.  Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus.2 We evaluated the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on different surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian regression model</jats:p>",doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217,,,2020,3,10,"'Neeltje van Doremalen', 'Trenton Bushmaker', 'Dylan Morris', 'Myndi Holbrook', 'Amandine Gamble', 'Brandi Williamson', 'Azaibi Tamin', 'Jennifer Harcourt', 'Natalie Thornburg', 'Susan Gerber', 'Jamie Lloyd-Smith', 'Emmie de Wit', 'Vincent Munster'",,sha: 0b48e1bfcdff9a42c88cc80a98661feb2703390d; source_x: medrxiv; license: See https://www.medrxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript; Microsoft Academic Paper ID: ; WHO #Covidence: ; has_full_text: True
